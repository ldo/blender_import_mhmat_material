I wrote these tools to make use of the assets available at
<http://www.makehumancommunity.org/content/user_contributed_assets.html>.
These are meant for use in MakeHuman, but then the models are going to
be exported back to Blender anyway, so I thought there should be a way
to bring the material definitions directly into Blender. Hence the
import_mhmat_material addon. There is already a standard importer for
the .obj files that come with the assets; this one lets you load the
.mhmat files in a usable form as well.

I also found that several of the material definitions referenced
texture files under the wrong names. So the validate_mhmat script lets
you quickly check for these from the command line, rather than waiting
to hit an error when you try to import them into Blender. You can pass
it one or more .mhmat files as arguments. To quickly check the entire
contents of a directory (and any subdirectories recursively), try
something like

    find «dir» -name \*mhmat -print0 | xargs -0 validate_mhmat

Fixing up the .mhmat files is pretty easy, since they are just
text files in a fairly obvious keyword-value format.
